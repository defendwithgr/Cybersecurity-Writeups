Remember when phishing emails were easy to spot? The ones full of typos, sketchy logos, and “urgent bank notices” that looked nothing like the real thing?

Those days are gone.

Enter SpamGPT: a phishing toolkit that looks less like a hacker’s homemade script and more like a polished SaaS platform you’d expect from a startup. Reading about it felt like scrolling through a product pitch, except this product is built to outsmart our inboxes.

This post reflects my own thoughts after reading an insightful article by Daniel Kelley on Varonis about SpamGPT.

What Exactly is SpamGPT?
Think of SpamGPT as the Mailchimp or HubSpot of cybercrime. Instead of helping businesses run email campaigns, it helps criminals run phishing campaigns.

Here’s the scary part, it comes with features we usually associate with professional tools:


AI-powered writing assistant (KaliGPT): Creates convincing phishing emails with the right tone, grammar, and formatting.

Inbox placement tests: Lets attackers see if their email lands in spam, quarantine, or the inbox.

SMTP/IMAP server rotation: Helps avoid blacklisting by cycling through different servers.

Sender spoofing tools: Makes an email look like it came from your CEO or bank.

Campaign analytics: Real-time stats on which emails slipped through and got opened.

Training modules: Even less technical criminals can learn tricks like SMTP cracking to expand their reach.

This isn’t “spray-and-pray” spam anymore. It’s precision-engineered phishing.




How It Looks in the Wild
Here’s where it gets real. If you’re monitoring systems or logs, this is what SpamGPT activity could look like:


SMTP cracking attempts: Bursts of failed AUTH LOGIN requests from multiple IPs, classic brute force behavior.

Domain spoofing: Emails from ceo@yourcompany.com slipping through because DMARC is set to p=none.

Deliverability tests: A trickle of harmless-looking test emails before a sudden surge of malicious campaigns.

Inbox checking: Unusual IMAP logins to attacker-controlled mailboxes right after phishing bursts.

In other words, the activity isn’t loud or sloppy. It’s measured, tested, and optimized, just like a marketing campaign.


What We Can Do About It
SpamGPT is a reminder that phishing is no longer amateur hour. Here’s how we fight back:



Tighten email authentication: SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, configured properly and enforced. No halfway measures.

Look for anomalies, not just signatures: An email can “look right” but still behave wrong. Check reply-to fields, sending volume, and header mismatches.

Upgrade detection: Legacy filters won’t cut it. Use AI/ML-based email security that spots behavioral patterns.

Keep training real: Don’t just show employees broken-English phishing. Use simulations that mimic polished AI-generated attacks.

Promote reporting culture: Make it safe and simple to hit “report suspicious email.” Reward vigilance, not silence.

Enforce MFA everywhere: Even if credentials get phished, MFA can be the tripwire that stops attackers cold.

Run tabletop exercises: Practice “what if” scenarios, what happens if 50 employees click a SpamGPT-crafted link?

Correlate logs: Tie email events to identity and endpoint telemetry. Phishing doesn’t stop at the inbox.

Back up & restrict access: Assume some attacks succeed. Protect critical data with least privilege and test your recovery plan.

Share intelligence: Talk about tools like SpamGPT with peers, clients, and industry groups. Awareness is defense.

Final Thoughts


SpamGPT is phishing with a growth strategy. Dashboards, analytics, AI assistants, the same tools we use to reach customers are now being used to reach victims.
And that changes the game.

We can’t defend against tomorrow’s threats with yesterday’s playbooks. Spotting typos isn’t enough anymore. It’s about layered defenses, smarter detection, and training people to pause, even when an email looks “perfect.”

Because the inbox has become a battlefield. And SpamGPT just raised the stakes.
